The Monty language

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Requirements

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
No more than 5 functions per file
You are allowed to use the C standard library
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called monty.h
Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project
